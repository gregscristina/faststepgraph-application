  # Application of FastStepGraph to Breast Cancer Genomic Data

This folder contains a complete pipeline to apply the **Fast Step Graph** algorithm to four breast cancer gene expression datasets, stratified by estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor status.

It includes: 

- Preprocessed gene expression datasets from CPTAC (PAM50 breast cancer dataset)
- An automated pipeline for hyperparameter selection and sparse precision matrix estimation using Fast Step Graph
- All data and scripts are under:  
  `Application on breastcancer genomic dataset/`
